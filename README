Additional disclaimers and comments:

* Due primarily to my lack of time, there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT AND
MAINTENANCE available for Isis.  Please consider this carefully when
making your choice of software to use for your project.  You are free
to write to me informally with questions and bug reports, but do not
expect a response quickly or at all.  However, I or others that I can
recommend might be available on a consultant/payment basis to assist
with Isis programming issues -- please email me for information.

* If you use Isis in a project or product, please consider including a
message to this effect somewhere in the project's documentation or
credits and a link/URL to the Isis web site if possible.

* I like to keep track of what people are doing with Isis!  Send me a
link or document about your project.  I might ask you if I can post
your link on the Isis web site.

* If you make a cool Isis or C library that you think others might
like to use, let me know and, when I get a chance, I'll add a link to
it from the Isis web site.

* Isis has thus far benefited from a high level of interoperability
and backward compatibility.  Therefore, I would like to discourage
changes begin made to the core Isis interpreter code since it may
result in incompatible syntax or unexpected behavior.  If you do make
changes to the core language and intend to distribute them, please
give your variant a different name.
